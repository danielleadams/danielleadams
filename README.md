### Hello

👋🏻 I'm a software engineer, public speaker, and retired open source contributor that is based in Austin, TX.

💻 I have been coding since age 12. After years of dabbling, I eventually made my way into a software engineer role. I have since been working on platforms that help people do their jobs with the help of software.

🕵🏻‍♀️ I'm currently a software engineer at Amazon, where I work on Amazon's Privacy team.
